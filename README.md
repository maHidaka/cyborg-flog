# CyborgFrog

This repository is the software for the driver board that I created to control the frog with electricity.

## INFO
There is an explanation about the circuit I am using on the following website.


## Usage
This project is developed using PlatformIO, but you can also use ArduinoIDE for development.
You can download this repository and use it by writing src/main.cpp to the board.
You will need to prepare the libraries that are written in platformio.ini separately.
